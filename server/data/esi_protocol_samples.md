# Emergency Severity Index (ESI) Protocol

## ESI Level 1 - Immediate (Life-threatening)
- Cardiac arrest
- Major trauma with unstable vital signs
- Respiratory arrest or severe respiratory distress
- Active seizures
- Unresponsive patients
- Severe hemorrhage with hemodynamic instability
- Signs of imminent cardiac or respiratory arrest

**Immediate Action Required**: Direct to resuscitation room, immediate physician evaluation

## ESI Level 2 - Emergent (High Risk)
- Chest pain with cardiac risk factors
- Difficulty breathing with abnormal vital signs
- Severe pain (8-10/10)
- High-risk chief complaints with concerning vital signs
- Active psychiatric emergencies with safety concerns
- Signs of stroke or neurological emergency
- Severe allergic reactions

**Action Required**: Immediate triage, physician evaluation within 10 minutes

## ESI Level 3 - Urgent (Stable with Multiple Resources)
- Stable vital signs but multiple resources needed
- Moderate to severe symptoms requiring investigation
- Chest pain with low cardiac risk
- Abdominal pain requiring workup
- Fever with concerning symptoms
- Injuries requiring imaging or procedures
- Psychiatric patients requiring evaluation

**Action Required**: Physician evaluation within 30 minutes

## ESI Level 4 - Less Urgent (One Resource)
- Stable patients requiring one resource
- Minor injuries
- Prescription refills
- Simple procedures (suture removal, etc.)
- Follow-up visits
- Low-risk chief complaints

**Action Required**: Can wait up to 1-2 hours if necessary

## ESI Level 5 - Non-urgent (No Resources)
- Very minor complaints
- Medication questions
- Simple advice
- Non-urgent administrative issues
- Routine follow-ups

**Action Required**: Can wait several hours if necessary

## Red Flag Symptoms (Immediate Escalation)
- Chest pain in patients over 40 or with cardiac history
- Any difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
- Altered mental status or confusion
- Severe pain (8-10/10 on pain scale)
- Signs of stroke (facial drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty)
- Active bleeding that cannot be controlled
- High fever (>102°F) with other concerning symptoms
- Suicidal or homicidal ideation
- Allergic reactions with breathing difficulty

## Vital Sign Considerations
**Adult Normal Ranges:**
- Heart Rate: 60-100 bpm
- Blood Pressure: 90/60 - 140/90 mmHg
- Respiratory Rate: 12-20 breaths/min
- Temperature: 97-99°F (36-37°C)
- Oxygen Saturation: >95%

**Pediatric Considerations:**
- Age-appropriate vital sign ranges
- Different pain assessment tools
- Parental presence considerations
- Immunization status relevance

## Special Populations
**Elderly Patients:**
- May not present with typical symptoms
- Consider baseline functional status
- Medication interactions
- Fall risk assessment

**Pediatric Patients:**
- Age-appropriate assessment
- Immunization status
- Growth and development considerations
- Caregiver concerns

**Pregnant Patients:**
- Gestational age considerations
- Fetal monitoring if indicated
- Pregnancy-specific complications
- Medication safety in pregnancy
