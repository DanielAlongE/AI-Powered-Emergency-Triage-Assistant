**(The scene opens with Nurse Maria seeing Jessica being wheeled toward her. She immediately steps out from behind her desk.)**

**Nurse Maria:** "Hi, bring her right here. I'm Maria. What's happening?"

**Jessica:** (Speaking in a pained, tight voice) "It's my stomach... I have this horrible pain."

**Nurse Maria:** "Okay, Jessica, I'm going to get your vital signs while we talk. Where exactly is the pain?"

**Jessica:** "It started kind of all over this morning, but for the last few hours, it's settled deep down here, on my right side." (She gestures vaguely to her right lower abdomen).

**Nurse Maria:** "And is it a sharp pain? Or is it cramping?"

**Jessica:** "It's a constant, sharp pain. It's so intense. And it's getting worse."

**Nurse Maria:** "On a scale of 0 to 10, what would you give it right now?"

**Jessica:** "An 8 or a 9. It hurts to move, to breathe, everything."

**Nurse Maria:** (Watching the vital signs monitor as the cuff inflates) "I can see that. Have you had any nausea or vomiting with this?"

**Jessica:** "I threw up twice in the car on the way here. There wasn't much in my stomach."

**Nurse Maria:** "What about a fever or chills?"

**Jessica:** "I feel like I'm burning up, but I'm shivering at the same time."

**Nurse Maria:** "Okay, Jessica, I have to ask a very important question. When was your last menstrual period?"

**Jessica:** (Hesitates) "I... I think I'm late. Maybe by two weeks?"

**Nurse Maria:** "So there is a possibility you could be pregnant?"

**Jessica:** "Yes, I suppose it's possible."

**Nurse Maria:** (Her tone becomes even more focused. She takes off the blood pressure cuff) "Okay. Thank you. Your heart rate is very high and you have a fever. The location of your pain, combined with everything else you've told me, is very concerning. We need to rule out several serious things right now, like appendicitis or an ectopic pregnancy."

**(She quickly and efficiently places an orange wristband on Jessica's arm.)**

**Nurse Maria:** "Jessica, you're not going to the waiting room. We're taking you to a treatment room immediately. The team is waiting for you. We're going to get an IV line started, draw blood, and get a urine sample right away. The doctor will be in to examine you within minutes."

**Jessica:** (Voice trembling with pain and fear) "Okay. I'm scared."

**Nurse Maria:** "I know, but you are our priority right now. We're going to move fast to figure this out and get your pain under control. Let's go."

**(Nurse Maria immediately begins pushing the wheelchair through the doors into the main department, calling out to her team as she goes.)**
