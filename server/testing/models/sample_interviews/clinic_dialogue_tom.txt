**(The scene opens with Nurse Michael approaching Tom, who has been wheeled to the triage station by his wife.)**

**Nurse Michael:** "Hi there, I'm Michael. What seems to be the problem today?"

**Tom:** (Grimacing as he adjusts his position) "Hi. I was playing soccer with my kids and I twisted my ankle pretty badly about an hour ago."

**Nurse Michael:** "Okay, let's talk about that. Can you tell me exactly how it happened?"

**Tom:** "I went to kick the ball and my foot planted awkwardly in the grass. My whole ankle just rolled inwards, and my body weight went with it."

**Nurse Michael:** "Did you hear or feel a 'pop' or a 'snap' when that happened?"

**Tom:** "Yeah, there was a definite, loud pop. It hurt right away."

**Nurse Michael:** "Are you able to put any weight on it at all?"

**Tom:** "Absolutely not. As soon as I try, it's a sharp, shooting pain right on the bone on the outside of my ankle."

**Nurse Michael:** (Visually inspecting the ankle, which is visibly swollen and starting to bruise) "I can see it's already quite swollen. On a scale of 0 to 10, how would you rate the pain right now, just sitting there?"

**Tom:** "It's about a 6 just sitting still. If I move it, it's a 9."

**Nurse Michael:** "Have you taken anything for the pain?"

**Tom:** "I took two Tylenol right after it happened, but it hasn't helped much. My wife grabbed the frozen peas for the car ride here."

**Nurse Michael:** "Good, ice is the right thing to do. Do you have any other injuries? Did you hit your head?"

**Tom:** "No, just the ankle."

**Nurse Michael:** "Any past injuries to this ankle? Or any other medical problems, like diabetes or circulation issues?"

**Tom:** "I sprained it once in college, but never like this. I'm otherwise healthy."

**Nurse Michael:** (Takes Tom's blood pressure and checks his pulse) "Alright, Tom. Your vital signs are perfectly stable. Given the mechanism of injury, the 'pop' you heard, the specific location of the pain, and the fact you can't bear weight, the doctor will need an X-ray to rule out a fracture."

**(He attaches a yellow wristband to Tom's wrist.)**

**Nurse Michael:** "I'm putting this yellow wristband on you. This means your case is semi-urgent. You are stable, but you need diagnostics. We will get you in ahead of patients with less severe conditions."

**Tom:** "Okay, thank you. So what happens now?"

**Nurse Michael:** "Please have a seat in our sub-waiting area over there. It's important to keep your foot elevated, just like you're doing. I'll get you a proper ice pack to replace those peas. The wait to be moved into a room for an X-ray is currently about 45 to 60 minutes. We'll get to you as soon as we possibly can."

**Tom:** "Sounds good. I appreciate it."
