**(The scene opens with Peter approaching the triage window.)**

**Nurse Julianne:** "Good afternoon. How can I help you?"

**Peter:** (Slightly congested voice) "Hi. I think I have a cold. I was hoping to get a sick note for work and maybe some medicine."

**Nurse Julianne:** "Of course, let's get you checked in. How long have you been feeling this way?"

**Peter:** "It started about two days ago. First, it was a scratchy throat, and today I woke up with a runny nose and sneezing."

**Nurse Julianne:** (Typing on her computer) "Okay. And a fever? Have you checked your temperature?"

**Peter:** "No, I don't feel feverish. Maybe some body aches, but nothing serious."

**Nurse Julianne:** (Places a blood pressure cuff on his arm and an ear thermometer in his ear) "Alright. Any other symptoms? Shortness of breath, chest pain, a severe headache?"

**Peter:** "No, none of that. Really just my nose and throat. And a bit of a dry cough."

**Nurse Julianne:** "Do you have any chronic illnesses, like asthma or diabetes? Any medication allergies?"

**Peter:** "No, I'm healthy. And no allergies that I know of."

**Nurse Julianne:** (Looks at the vital signs readings) "Okay, Peter. Your blood pressure, oxygen, and temperature are all normal. From what you're describing, it sounds like a typical upper respiratory infection, a common cold."

**(She hands him a green wristband.)**

**Nurse Julianne:** "I'm going to give you this green wristband. This means your condition is not an emergency, and you'll be seen in the order of arrival, after the more urgent cases."

**Peter:** "No problem. Do you have an idea of the wait time?"

**Nurse Julianne:** "The wait for your classification is currently about one to two hours. You can have a seat in the main waiting area and watch for your name on the monitor. If you start to feel worse—like you develop a high fever or shortness of breath—please come back and let me know immediately."

**Peter:** "Sounds good. Thank you very much."

**(Peter takes his documents and heads to the main waiting area.)**
