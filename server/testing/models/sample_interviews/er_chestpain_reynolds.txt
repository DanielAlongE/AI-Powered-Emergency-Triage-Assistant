**Setting:** The walk-in entrance of a hospital Emergency Department. The automated doors slide open and a middle-aged man stumbles in, clutching his chest. He is pale, sweating profusely, and his face is contorted in pain.

**Characters:**

* **Nurse Ana:** The triage nurse, who immediately recognizes the emergency.
* **Mr. Reynolds:** A 56-year-old man in severe distress.
* **ER Tech:** Another staff member who joins to assist.

**(The scene opens with Nurse Ana looking up from her desk and seeing Mr. Reynolds stumble through the door. She doesn't speak—she acts, immediately grabbing a wheelchair and rushing to him.)**

**Nurse Ana:** "Sir! Right here, sit down! What's happening?"

**Mr. Reynolds:** (Gasping, barely able to speak) "Chest... can't... breathe... crushing..."

**Nurse Ana:** (Simultaneously pushing him towards the clinical area and shouting over her shoulder) "I NEED A ROOM NOW! BRING THE STRETCHER! RESUSCITATION BAY ONE!"

**(An ER Tech immediately appears with a stretcher and they intercept the wheelchair.)**

**ER Tech:** "Got it, Ana!"

**Nurse Ana:** (To the Tech, as they quickly but carefully help Mr. Reynolds from the chair to the stretcher) "Get his shirt off, get him on the monitor, and grab the EKG machine. STAT!"

**Nurse Ana:** (To Mr. Reynolds, as they are now moving rapidly down the hall on the stretcher) "Mr. Reynolds, stay with me. My name is Ana. The pain—is it traveling anywhere? To your arm? Your neck? Your jaw?"

**Mr. Reynolds:** (Eyes squeezed shut) "My jaw... my whole left arm feels heavy..."

**Nurse Ana:** "Are you nauseous? Dizzy?"

**Mr. Reynolds:** "Feel like I'm going to throw up... The room is spinning..."

**Nurse Ana:** "Do you have any history of heart problems? High blood pressure? Diabetes?"

**Mr. Reynolds:** (Shakes his head weakly) "No... nothing..."

**Nurse Ana:** "Did you take any medications before you came in? Even an aspirin?"

**Mr. Reynolds:** "No... just happened... so fast..."

**(They burst through the doors of a resuscitation room, where an ER doctor and another nurse are waiting.)**

**Nurse Ana:** (Giving a concise, urgent report as the team swarms the patient) "This is Mr. Reynolds, 56. Acute onset of crushing, substernal chest pain that started 20 minutes ago. Radiating to the left arm and jaw. He's pale, diaphoretic, and short of breath. No cardiac history. No meds on board."

**ER Doctor:** "Right. Let's get him on high-flow oxygen. I need two large-bore IVs, now! Let's get that EKG and a portable chest X-ray. And get me the cardiac medication tray!"

**(The dialogue of the triage nurse ends here as the resuscitation team fully takes over, a seamless handoff from initial contact to definitive care within minutes.)**
